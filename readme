*Simple Simon Read Me*

Simple Features

    1.To begin the game click the "Start" button.
    2.Once the button has been clicked it will begin the "Simon Sequence".
    3.With each correct sequence the user inputs, the difficulty will become harder and
      the round number will change accordingly.
    4. If the user inputs the wrong sequence, an alert will pop up and inform the user that he/she has lost.
    5. Once the user loses, the wording within the start button says "Start Over."


Things to Add/Fix

    1. User Interface (U.I.) can be updated to be more appealing or user friendly.
    2. Can and maybe should add a feature that makes the sequences run faster after a predetermined
       amount of rounds.
    3. Add sound to the squares (now circles) so when they flash a different sound is played for each one.
